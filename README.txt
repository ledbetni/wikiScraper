To use the wikipedia scraper microservice simply fire up the wikiServer.py file and make a post request to localhost:1400

The wikiServer.py file will print the wikipedia summary to console as well as return this data in a JSON object

You may change the port to your liking

The wikiApp.py file functions as a client to and is set up to make post requests from a string you enter on the command line, but is not necessary if you plan to make the requests from your own program!

Please message me on discord with any questions!!
